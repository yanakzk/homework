    <p>
        Your therapist will explain the process of hypnosis and review your treatment goals.
        Then the therapist will typically talk in a gentle, soothing tone and describe images 
        that create a sense of relaxation, security and well-being.
        When you're in a receptive state, the therapist will suggest ways for you to achieve 
        your goals, such as reducing pain or eliminating cravings to smoke. 
        The therapist may also help you visualize vivid, meaningful mental images of yourself 
        accomplishing your goals.
        When the session is over, either you are able to bring yourself out of hypnosis or your 
        therapist helps you end your state of relaxation.
